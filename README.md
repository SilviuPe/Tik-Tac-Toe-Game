Tik Tac Toe game. Made in Python with pygame library. You can clone the repo and start playing with your friends or customize it.
# Libraries:

  A cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.
### Photopea: 
  Photopea is a web-based photo and graphics editor. It is used for image editing, making illustrations, web design or converting between different image formats. I used this tool to create the assets for the game.
### Figma:
  Figma design is for people to create, share, and test designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products and experiences. It is a popular tool for designers, product managers, writers and developers and helps anyone involved in the design process contribute, give feedback, and make better decisions, faster. I used this tool to create the design and UI for the game.
